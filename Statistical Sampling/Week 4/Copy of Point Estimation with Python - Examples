But since the adult population is too large, it would take alot of time and resources to take a survey of all the adult population. An alternative to this, we could take survey of a random sample from the adult population and then calculate the average height from this. The average height we get from the sample would be our point estimate for the average height of the population.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"R3_ln08y_FnN","colab_type":"text"},"source":["Let's use the above example to explain the concept of point estimation using python.\n","\n","We are going to make two assumption:\n","\n","\n","1.
